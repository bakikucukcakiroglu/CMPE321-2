--The first subquery returns the maximum number of films that is recorded by a director for each genre. 
--The second subquery returns the number of films of each director for each genre. 
--Inner join of the first and the second subqueries gives the director with the maximum number of films for corresponding genre. 
--Only the first subquery would work if the assumption that the maximum number of films record holder is unique for each genre had been guaranteed to hold. 
--As keyword is used to show the second column of the output as 'Film_Count'
