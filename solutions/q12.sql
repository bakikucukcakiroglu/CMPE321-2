--The first subquery returns the maximum budget spent each year. It uses grouping to achieve this. 
--The secÄ±nd subquery returns all films and directors all together. It simply takes cross product of Film and Director tables.
--Inner join of the first and the second subqueries gives all possibble films that have the maximum budget for the year they are recorded. 
--Only the first subquery would work if the assumption that each year only one film recorded with the maximum budget had been guaranteed to hold. 
--As keyword is used to show the second column of the output as 'Max_Budget'
